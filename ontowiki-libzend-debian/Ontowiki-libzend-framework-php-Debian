Description: Dummy package to alleviate Ubuntu package names 
 This is a Debian specific dependency package to alleviate negligence on the part of LOD2 maintainers to cater for Debian Package names and dependenciec, and not just Ubuntu package names.
 .
 If this approach works, I will file a bug. and a pull-request at GtiHub.
 .
 I have now made this work in Debian Squeeze. Only manual config issue is adding a correct AddHandler line to the apache config. This should be done upstream by including the required line in the "/etc/apache2/conf.d/ontowiki" configuration file as foolows:
 AddHandler application/x-httpd-php5 .php .phtml
